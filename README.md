## About
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating prototypes of mini-games using Unity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity,  Golang, Tailwind, and AlpineJS
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am forgetful that every time I use C#, I always forget to put a semi-colon at the end of the statement, and when I use Golang, I forget not to use a semi-colon.
